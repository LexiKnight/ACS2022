To estimate the total number of respondents in each state using the ratio estimators approach, we can follow the Laplace method using the given hint. Specifically, we will calculate the ratio between respondents with doctoral degrees in California (STATEICP) and the total number of respondents in California, and then apply that ratio to other states' doctoral degree respondents.

Hereâ€™s the general procedure:
Calculate the Ratio for California: Let:

Dca = be the number of respondents with doctoral degrees in California.
Nca = be the total number of respondents in California (which is 391,171, as provided).

Rca = The ratio of doctoral degree holders to total respondents in California is

Rca = Dca / Nca

For each other state, we can use the ratio to estimate the total number of respondents in that state:
Ni = be the total number of respondents in state i (which we are estimating).
Di = be the number of respondents with doctoral degrees in state i. 

Ni = Di / Rca
